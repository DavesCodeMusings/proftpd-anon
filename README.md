# proftpd-anon
Anonymous FTP Docker container for Raspberry Pi / ARM

Ansible playbook to build the container. Requires Ansible 2.9 and community.docker from Ansible Galaxy. If Ansible's not your bag, simply copy and paste the contents of Dockerfile and proftpd.conf out of the playbook and run the `docker build` command manually.
